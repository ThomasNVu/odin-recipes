        <h4>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is 
        my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by 
        using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice 
        and tonkatsu sauce.</h4>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and 
            pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into 
            separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, 
            shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press 
            into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 
            3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined 
            plate to drain. </li>
        </ol>
