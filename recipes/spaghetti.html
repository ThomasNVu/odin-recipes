        <img src="../images/spaghetti.webp" alt="Spaghetti Image">
        <h4>This crockpot spaghetti sauce creates a great, chunky,
        and very meaty spaghetti sauce. The longer it cooks in
        your slow cooker, the better it tastes! Boil up some pasta,
        and dinner tastes like you spent all day at the stove!</h4>
